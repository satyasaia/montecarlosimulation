# MonteCarloSimulation
A Probability Problem Which is not Mathematically Derived yet, This is a quantitative estimation of minimum threshold probability of a cell in the grid for it percolate by running simulations using
WeightedQuickUnionFind with Path compression data structure to represent the connections in the grid formed by open cells and opening cells at random until the system percolates
and finding the ratio of number of open cells and N*N (where N is the Side of the Grid), for T times so that we get consistent average result for threshold probability.
